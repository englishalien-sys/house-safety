Home Safety System
1. Introduction
A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for home safety outlines functional, non-functional, and interface requirements for systems designed to protect residents from hazards like fire, theft, or medical emergencies. It defines user needs, system features (e.g., motion sensors, cameras), operating environment, and performance constraints. 
1 Purpose: Define the goal (e.g., monitor, detect, and alert on safety hazards).
 Scope: Describe the system, such as a smart home security and environmental safety network.
 Definitions & Acronyms: Define terms like HSS (Home Security System), PIR (Passive Infrared sensor).
2. Overall Description
 Product Perspective: How the system fits into the home (e.g., IoT-enabled, standalone).
 Product Functions: List key features: motion detection, smoke alarm, perimeter breach alerts.
 User Classes/Characteristics: Define users (homeowner, admin).
 Operating Environment: Requirements for internet, power supply, or mobile OS.
2. Functional Requirements
 System Features (e.g., Intrusion Detection): "When [event], the system shall [response]" (e.g., "When door opens after 10 PM, system shall trigger alarm and send notification").
 Environmental Monitoring: Smoke, carbon monoxide, or water leak detection.
 Data Management: Logging security events and storing camera footage.
3. Non-functional Requirements
 Safety: Requirements for fail-safe modes (e.g., battery backup during power failure).
 Security: Encryption for data transmission and user authentication (login/password).
 Reliability/Availability: Maximum downtime allowed, 24/7 monitoring.

4. External Interface Requirements
 User Interfaces: Mobile app layout, web dashboard, voice command integration.
 Hardware Interfaces: Specifications for cameras, PIR sensors, smart locks.
 Communication: Wi-Fi, Zigbee, or Bluetooth protocols.
